# Valorant Lineups on the Web

This project is the official port for the [Setups for Valorant](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/setups-for-valorant/id1512758683?mt=8) App on iOS. We created this so our content is not exclusive to iOS and can be consumed by PC and Android users aswell.

Done in collaboration with [github.com/LucaKaufmann](https://github.com/LucaKaufmann). He provided the dataset and is the creator and maintainer for the iOS App.
